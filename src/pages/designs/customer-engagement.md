  <h2 class="text-h2 no-underline">Project Overview</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <p>
      <span class="text-h6 mr-1">Company:</span>Saylent Technologies
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="text-h6 mr-1">Role:</span>UX Designer (First in-house designer)
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="text-h6 mr-1">Timeline:</span>2014-2016
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="text-h6 mr-1">Team:</span>
      Solo designer collaborating with 2 Product Managers, 6 Engineers
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="text-h6 mr-1">THE CHALLENGE:</span>
      Saylent Technologies' Customer Engagement App (CEA) was a critical platform for credit unions and regional banks to track customer engagement and manage marketing campaigns. However, the existing interface was outdated, cluttered, and difficult to use—resulting in frustrated users and inefficient workflows.
      <p>The company needed a complete UX overhaul that would:
        <ul>
          <li>Modernize the visual aesthetic to match contemporary SaaS standards</li>
          <li>Improve usability and reduce time-to-complete common tasks</li>
          <li>Create a scalable design system for future product development</li>
          <li>Establish design processes and standards for the growing product team</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="text-h6 mr-1">THE SOLUTION:</span>
      As Saylent's first in-house UX designer, I led a complete redesign of the Customer Engagement App from the ground up. I established user-centered design processes, conducted research with financial services users, and created a comprehensive design system that would serve as the foundation for all future Saylent products.
    <p>
      <span class="text-h6 mr-1">THE IMPACT:</span>
      <br/>
      <ul>
        <li>Reduced design-to-development time by 40% through reusable UI component library</li>
        <li>Improved user task completion efficiency through streamlined workflows</li>
        <li>Established design system adopted across multiple Saylent products</li>
        <li>Created first formal UX research and testing program at Saylent</li>
        <li>Set design standards that influenced company-wide product development</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Before starting on the updated design for the Customer Engagement App (CEA), I first took to creating an updated sitemap. This allowed me to set a basic path for users to navigate through the application, while also separating the pieces of the application into useful areas.</p>

      <h3 class="p-0">What I Learned</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="card-body">
      <p>
        This project taught me invaluable lessons about establishing design practice at a growing company:
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Design systems pay dividends.</strong> The reduction in design-to-development time came directly from creating reusable, well-documented components. The upfront investment in building a component library saved countless hours on future projects.</li>
          <li><strong>Being the first designer means building infrastructure.</strong> Beyond just designing screens, I had to establish processes for user research, usability testing, design reviews, and design-dev collaboration. This foundational work enabled Saylent to scale its design practice as the team grew.</li>
          <li>Financial services <strong>users value clarity and confidence</strong>. Through research, I learned that our users prioritized clear labeling, logical workflows, and confirmation steps over flashy interactions.</li>
          <li><strong>Documentation is as important as the designs themselves.</strong> The component library was only valuable because it included clear usage guidelines, code snippets, and examples. This taught me that design deliverables must include the context engineers need to implement them correctly.
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        The success of this redesign demonstrated the value of user-centered design at Saylent and paved the way for building a mature design practice at the company.

      <h3 class="p-0">Final thoughts</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="card-body">
      <p>I believe that the process used for this project, albeit different, fit within the framework given and met all of the requirements as laid out by the Project Management Team. In the end, a new interface was created that met all of the requirements and was based off of clear steps and proper research. Competitively, this new design met, and often surpassed, expectations when compared to what was in use prior to this project.</p>
