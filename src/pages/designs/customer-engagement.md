      <p>Before starting on the updated design for the Customer Engagement App (CEA), I first took to creating an updated sitemap. This allowed me to set a basic path for users to navigate through the application, while also separating the pieces of the application into useful areas.</p>

  <h2>Visual Designs</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <div class="card-body">
      <p>These visual designs are a small sampling of the final screens that were implemented as part of the completion of this project. The Dashboard, Reporting screen, and Settings page were considered the high-value items and contained the majority of the different components that would be used across the project. This set the baseline for future screens and allowed the development team to create a component library in which to build upon.</p>

      <p>I believe that the process used for this project, albeit different, fit within the framework given and met all of the requirements as laid out by the Project Management Team. In the end, a new interface was created that met all of the requirements and was based off of clear steps and proper research. Competitively, this new design met, and often surpassed, expectations when compared to what was in use prior to this project.</p>
