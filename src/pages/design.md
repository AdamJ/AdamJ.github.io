      <p class="lead">The goal of this redesign was to create a simplistic system to easily access recent log entries, active projects, and team calendars. From this dashboard, users can quickly see these items, in addition to providing quick navigation items for in-depth reporting.</p>

      <p class="lead">The members of the 25th District reached out to me to update their outdated design with something new and clean that would draw new users in, while also quickly and easily displaying information that existing users consistently want to access. Through this process, I worked with the leadership committee to create a clean solution, while keeping a consistent feel across the platform.</p>
