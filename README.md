# Adam Jolicoeur - Portfolio Site

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website at [adamjolicoeur.com](https://adamjolicoeur.com), built with Eleventy (11ty) and deployed via GitHub Pages.

## About This Repository

This is a **personal portfolio site** showcasing my work as a Lead Product Designer and Product Manager. The site features:

- **Design Case Studies** - UX/UI projects from AWS, Red Hat, and Component Assembly Systems
- **Development Projects** - Open source contributions, tools, and code examples
- **Professional Content** - Resume, presentations, and technical articles
- **App Showcases** - iOS/iPadOS apps and web applications

## Usage & Ownership

**All content, design work, code, and assets in this repository are for my personal use only.** This is a public repository for transparency and to demonstrate my development workflow, but the content is not licensed for reuse.

## About Me

I'm a user experience designer with 15+ years of enterprise experience at companies like AWS and Red Hat. With a background in web development, I bridge the gap between design and technical implementation, turning designs into living, usable products.

## Automation & Releases

**Automation** is handled by GitHub Actions, which sets Labels for pull requests and Releases versioning. I use [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com) to create pull request previews.

**Releases** are done via the [release-drafter](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/release-drafter) GitHub Action. Release notes are automatically generated from the pull request title and description.
