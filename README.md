# Welcome

This is the repo for my portfolio site, adamjolicoeur.com, hosted on GitHub.

## Who am I?

I'm a user experience designer with a passion for creating data-intensive designs. With a background in web development, I enjoy turning my designs into living, usable products.

## Why here?

I decided to build my own portfolio site on GitHub, rather than on a less code-oriented platform, in order to keep my skills sharp, up-to-date, and to do everything in the open.

## How was it created?

I used Figma for designing the site, VSCode with iTerm for development, NodeJS as the runtime environment with Eleventy as the site generator, and Bootstrap as the toolkit.

### Figma

For designing my portfolio, I used [Figma](https://www.figma.com) so that I could design in the open using the latest technology.

### Eleventy

This site is built using [Eleventy+Nunjucks](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/languages/nunjucks/) with [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com) as the frontend toolkit. Custom CSS is applied in order to create a personalized experience.

### NodeJS

The project uses NodeJS as it's runtime environment. Currently, `22.6.0` is the latest version is use and is set using Node Version Manager (NVM). To set a local environment, enter `nvm use` into a terminal while inside of the project folder. _You must have node installed on your machine with nvm_

### Automation & Releases

**Automation** is handled by GitHub Actions, which sets Labels for pull requests and Releases versioning. I use [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) to create pull request previews.

**Releases** are done via the [release-drafter](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/release-drafter) GitHub Action. Release notes are automatically generated from the pull request title and description.

## Can I use it?

At the moment this repo is very personalized to my needs and my information, so I would not recommend it. I will be creating a template in the near future, which I will welcome anyone to use and contribute to.
