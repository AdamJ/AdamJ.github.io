# Welcome

This is the repo for my portfolio site, adamjolicoeur.com, hosted on GitHub.

## Who am I?

I'm a user experience designer with a passion for creating data-intensive designs. With a background in web development, I enjoy turning my designs into living, usable products.

## Why here?

I decided to build my own portfolio site on GitHub, rather than on a less code-oriented platform, in order to keep my skills sharp, up-to-date, and to do everything in the open.

## Automation & Releases

**Automation** is handled by GitHub Actions, which sets Labels for pull requests and Releases versioning. I use [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com) to create pull request previews.

**Releases** are done via the [release-drafter](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/release-drafter) GitHub Action. Release notes are automatically generated from the pull request title and description.
