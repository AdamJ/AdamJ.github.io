# Welcome!
This is the repo for my portfolio site, adamjolicoeur.com, hosted on GitHub.

## Who am I?
I'm a user experience designer with a passion for creating data-intensive designs. With a background in web development, I enjoy turning my designs into living, usable products.

## Why here?
I decided to build my own portfolio site on GitHub, rather than on a less code-oriented platform, in order to keep my skills sharp, up-to-date, and to do everything in the open.

## How was it created?
I used Figma for designing the site, VSCode w/iTerm as my development environment, Eleventy as the site generator, and Bootstrap as the toolkit.

### Figma
For designing my portfolio, I used [Figma](https://www.figma.com) so that I could design in the open using the latest technology. 

### Eleventy
This site is built using [Eleventy+Nunjucks](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/languages/nunjucks/) with [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com) as the frontend toolkit. Custom CSS is applied in order to create a personalized experience.

### Automation & Releases

**Automation** is handled by GitHub Actions, which sets Labels for pull requests and Releases versioning. I use [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) to create pull request previews.

**Releases** are done via the [release-drafter](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/release-drafter) GitHub Action. Release notes are automatically generated from the pull request title and description.

## Can I use it?
At the moment this repo is very personalized to my needs and my information, so I would not recommend it. I will be creating a template in the near future, which I will welcome anyone to use and contribute to.
