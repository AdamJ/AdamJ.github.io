            <h3 class="mb-3 pl-md-5">My name is Adam Jolicoeur, and I am running for Town Selectman.</h3>
            <p class="pl-md-5">Five years ago, I moved to Brookfield with my wife where together we live with our son and 2 dogs. We chose to move to Brookfield because of the community, local activities (we love to hike and kayak), and the school system. With both of us having grown up in tight-knit communities, we felt Brookfield would be the perfect place to start and raise a family. We love to support the community by attending events and buying local (especially from our local farmers). With everything happening over the past few months, it has become even more apparent that a town like Brookfield can still thrive.</p>
            <p class="pl-md-5">Why am I running? Because I know that we can do better as a town. By electing me, you will have someone working for you - no personal agendas, not biases, no looking backwards, and no change just for the sake of change.</p>

            <h2 class="mb-3">Background</h2>
            <p class="pl-md-5">I am an Eagle Scout (once an Eagle, always an Eagle) and have been a registered Boy Scout for 20 years. Locally, I am the Treasurer for three non-profit organizations, and am an avid hiker and kayaker. I've traveled around the world (Iceland, England, and the Czech Republic, to name a few) and have lived in a variety of towns across the state. I went to school in North Adams and have Bachelor Degrees in both Music and Arts Management.</p>
            <p class="pl-md-5">I graduated from Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts (MCLA) in 2008, with two Bachelor Degrees (Fine and Performing Arts with a Concentration in Music and Arts Management with a minor in Business Administration). I was also a student of Williams College's jazz program, performing in the Berkshires and traveling to Mexico City to teach students how to play and write jazz music.</p>
            <p class="pl-md-5">I currently work at Red Hat, Inc. (an open source software company based out of Westford with corporate headquarters in Raleigh, NC) as a Senior Software Engineer in the User Experience Department. I design and create applications and websites for various products and services, focusing on the user experience. My job has allowed me to travel around the country and world, presenting me with many opportunities to learn about new cultures and people.</p>
            <p class="pl-md-5">In my life, I have met almost every type of individual with every mix of personalities, which I believe will only help in my interactions with the members of our town. I know that Brookfield has the potential to become one of the premier towns in the area for those looking for a historical adventure spot where they can enjoy the quiet of nature while escaping the bustling city life.</p>

            <h2 class="mb-1">Experience</h2>
            <h4 class="pl-md-5"><b>Non-profit Work</b></h4>
            <p class="pl-md-5"><b>The Masonic Angel Foundation</b></p>
            <p class="pl-md-5">Through working with schools and other outreach programs, The MAF provides clothing and financial assistance to families in need. It is all anonymous (hence why we work with another group) and we never ask for names/addresses/etc - just what they need/how we can help.</p>
            <p class="pl-md-5"><b>The Rutland Masonic Charitable and Educational Association</b></p>
            <p class="pl-md-5">We work with the Rutland community to sponsor various events (4th of July Parade, Christmas celebrations, etc.) and provide community outreach. Our current building is actually one of the original schoolhouses in town, which our founders moved to it's current location around 1910.</p>
            <p class="pl-md-5"><b>Rufus Putnam Lodge A.F. & A.M.</b></p>
            <p class="pl-md-5">A Masonic Lodge based out of Rutland, MA. We contribute to various charities in Central Mass (concentrating in Rutland and the immediately surrounding towns), as well as support the Shriners Hospitals for Children and various youth organization (Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, DeMolay, and Rainbow).</p>
            <h4 class="pl-md-5"><b>Community outreach</b></h4>
            <p class="pl-md-5">I am part of a group of Eagle Scouts that assist potential Eagle Scouts with attaining the rank of Eagle. We travel around the Commonwealth to Court of Honors (when requested) to support those that have earned the rank of Eagle. When called upon, we provide manpower and/or financial assistance to those that request it - this is usually in the form of donations for/of supplies or by using our contacts to assist the Scout in their journey to Eagle.</p>

            <h2 class="mb-3">Positions</h2>
            <h4 class="mb-1">Hiring a Town Administrator</h4>
            <p class="pl-md-5">For the Town of Brookfield, I would like to see a  Town Administrator hired, but in a fiscally responsible manner. As a small town, we do not need to pay someone as if we are inside of 495. Salary should be appropriate for a town the size of Brookfield and commensurate with experience. While we do have a multitude of issues, I see Brookfield as a great opportunity for an up-and-coming administrator who loves small/historic towns but has goals that reach beyond the norm. </p>
            <p class="pl-md-5">As part of hiring a Town Administrator, I would propose the formation of committees to work with our elected officials, under the office of the Town Administrator. While the Town Administrator would report to the Selectmen, these committees would be there specifically to support the Town Administrator and to provide assistance with the multitude of jobs required of the position (including, but not limited to, fiscal management, operational oversight, collective bargaining, capital planning, labor relations, public construction, and procurement).</p>
            <p class="pl-md-5">It takes the appropriate checks and balances, a strong leadership structure, and fiscal responsibility to bring any entity out of mismanagement and back to a positive position.</p>
            <h4 class="mb-1">Tasse's Fuel (propane installation)</h4>
            <p class="pl-md-5">
              <b>Facts and Information:</b>
              Based off of the facts presented, I believe that having Tasse's Fuel in town would be a benefit to growing Brookfield's commercial footprint, while still maintaining a safe place to live. Not only is it permitted based off of the Brookfield Zoning By-Laws, but the installation and service has been approved by the Massachusetts State Fire Marshal's Office and no safety concerns have been expressed by either the Brookfield Fire Department or the Brookfield Police Department. Additionally, the current Board of Selectmen approved the storage license.
            </p>
            <p class="pl-md-5">
              <b>Financial Considerations:</b>
              According to the letter presented to the Town of Brookfield, Tasse's Fuel would bring in up to $25,000 a year in property and excise taxes. This money would be a of great use to the town, allowing us to improve our infrastructure, expand our community offerings (athletic fields updates, senior center enhancements, South Pond improvements, etc), and allow us to move towards a fiscally-positive position.
            </p>
            <h4 class="mb-1">Cable Access / Information Technology</h4>
            <p class="pl-md-5">Since I moved to Brookfield, I have watched various Town Meetings on YouTube, with varying degrees of quality and quantity of videos. Cable access, or any form of technology that provides accessibility to town functions, is pivotal for the community to become, and remain, engaged. With my background, I have the knowledge to assist the various committees with setting up video feeds and YouTube channels, which would allow Brookfield citizens to interact with the various committees, without having to be physically present (especially pertinent in this day and age).</p>
            <p class="pl-md-5">As a designer and developer, I would be able to apply my unique skills towards helping Brookfield grow our social footprint, and improve our continuity between our various platforms (website, Facebook, YouTube, etc), and reach out to those that have come to rely on technology in their daily lives.</p>
            <h4 class="mb-1">South Pond</h4>
            <p class="pl-md-5">South Pond is where my son was first introduced to swimming. South Pond was where my son was first introduced to a frozen body of water and walked on ice. South Pond is important to me and my family, and is important to the Town of Brookfield. Unfortunately, South Pond is seeming to fall in priority for the town (with the exception of the work of the Recreation Committee). Financially, Brookfield does not have the capacity to maintain South Pond without the assistance of the Lake Association and the donations from our neighbors ($15,000 from East Brookfield, as an example). As a Selectman, I would make sure that South Pond is made a priority, and that the proper resources are given to the Recreation Committee to support the upkeep and improvements required to keep South Pond as a town gem.</p>
            <p class="pl-md-5">We are in a unique position with South Pond and, without continued support from the town, it  will fall by the wayside and become another eyesore, rather than a beauty of the town.</p>
            <h4 class="mb-1">Town Hall</h4>
            <p class="pl-md-5">As we all know, our Town Hall is in dire need of updating and improvements. While renovations are in the works (such as the flooring in the Clerk's office), the building is not handicapped accessible, per ADA (American Disabilities Act) requirements. Not have a handicapped accessible building unfairly keeps residents out of our Town Hall. It is something that should be considered a priority, and one that I would make a priority. Our town may be older, with a historic atmosphere that the residents love, but that should not keep us from providing access to public buildings and resources that should be available to all.</p>
