  <h2>Hello!</h2>
  <p>
    UX Designer, Developer, Program Manager. Creating software for the construction world. Previously at Red Hat and AWS. Collector of nerdy things...forever.
  </p>
  <p>
    Adam Jolicoeur is a designer, developer, and program manager in Massachusetts. Starting as a help desk tech, he discovered a desire to create technology, rather than fixing it, which lead to a leap into the software engineering space.
  </p>
  <p>
    While working at a small startup, Adam discovered the world of user experience design and realized that his future was before him. With a background in fine arts and knowledge in the software development space (Backbone/Angular, anyone?), Adam took another step forward by becoming the first ux designer at a financial startup. Leading the next-generation of product design for card processors and financial institutions, Adam took that experience and used it to catapult into the world of publicly traded companies.
  </p>
  <p>
    With a move to Red Hat (later acquired by IBM), Adam accelerated his career path (and filled up many pages in his passport) by working with industry experts and the open source community on enterprise software experiences. After five years at Red Hat, Adam joined a small team at Amazon in AWS's Safety Engineering group to work on a new issue tracking and management product. While his time at Amazon came to abrupt end during the layoffs of 2023, the knowledge gained from such an environment only strengthened his desire to create in a collaborative and forward-looking space.
  </p>
  <p>
    Adam has continued his career at Component Assembly Systems as their Lead Program Manager and Head of UX.

  <h3 class="mt-4">Education</h3>
  <p>
    I attended MCLA (Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts, formerly North Adams State) graduating with degrees in Fine and Performing Arts and Arts Management. While at MCLA, I was the President of the Lacrosse Club (now a recognized D3 sport) while also receiving a variety of accolades such as Alpha Chi, National Scholars Honor Society, and the Who’s Who in American Colleges and Universities.
