            <p class="pl-md-5">Six years ago, I moved to Brookfield with my wife where together we live with our son, 3 dogs, and our horse. We chose to move to Brookfield because of the community, local activities (we love to hike and kayak), and the school system. With both of us having grown up in tight-knit communities, we felt Brookfield would be the perfect place to start and raise a family. We love to support the community by attending events and buying local (especially from our local farmers). With everything happening over the past few months, it has become even more apparent that a town like Brookfield can still thrive.</p>
            <p class="pl-md-5">Why am I running? Because I know that we can continue to improve as a town. By electing me, you will have someone working for you - no personal agendas, not biases, no looking backwards, and no change just for the sake of change.</p>

      <div class="my-3 py-3">
        <h2 class="mb-3">Background</h2>
        <p class="pl-md-5">I am an Eagle Scout (once an Eagle, always an Eagle) and have been a registered Boy Scout for 20 years. Locally, I am the Treasurer for three non-profit organizations, and am an avid hiker and kayaker. I've traveled around the world (Iceland, England, and the Czech Republic, to name a few) and have lived in a variety of towns across the state. I went to school in North Adams and have Bachelor Degrees in both Music and Arts Management.</p>
        <p class="pl-md-5">I graduated from Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts (MCLA) in 2008, with two Bachelor Degrees (Fine and Performing Arts with a Concentration in Music and Arts Management with a minor in Business Administration). I was also a student of Williams College's jazz program, performing in the Berkshires and traveling to Mexico City to teach students how to play and write jazz music.</p>
        <p class="pl-md-5">I currently work at Red Hat, Inc. (an open source software company based out of Westford with corporate headquarters in Raleigh, NC) as a Senior Software Engineer in the User Experience Department. I design and create applications and websites for various products and services, focusing on the user experience. My job has allowed me to travel around the country and world, presenting me with many opportunities to learn about new cultures and people.</p>
        <p class="pl-md-5">In my life, I have met almost every type of individual with every mix of personalities, which I believe will only help in my interactions with the members of our town. I know that Brookfield has the potential to become one of the premier towns in the area for those looking for a historical adventure spot where they can enjoy the quiet of nature while escaping the bustling city life.</p>

        <h2 class="mb-1">Experience</h2>
        <h4 class="pl-md-5"><b>Non-profit Work</b></h4>
        <p class="pl-md-5"><b>The Masonic Angel Foundation</b></p>
        <p class="pl-md-5">Through working with schools and other outreach programs, The MAF provides clothing and financial assistance to families in need. It is all anonymous (hence why we work with another group) and we never ask for names/addresses/etc - just what they need/how we can help.</p>
        <p class="pl-md-5"><b>The Rutland Masonic Charitable and Educational Association</b></p>
        <p class="pl-md-5">We work with the Rutland community to sponsor various events (4th of July Parade, Christmas celebrations, etc.) and provide community outreach. Our current building is actually one of the original schoolhouses in town, which our founders moved to it's current location around 1910.</p>
        <p class="pl-md-5"><b>Rufus Putnam Lodge A.F. & A.M.</b></p>
        <p class="pl-md-5">A Masonic Lodge based out of Rutland, MA. We contribute to various charities in Central Mass (concentrating in Rutland and the immediately surrounding towns), as well as support the Shriners Hospitals for Children and various youth organization (Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, DeMolay, and Rainbow).</p>
        <h4 class="pl-md-5"><b>Community outreach</b></h4>
        <p class="pl-md-5">I am part of a group of Eagle Scouts that assist potential Eagle Scouts with attaining the rank of Eagle. We travel around the Commonwealth to Court of Honors (when requested) to support those that have earned the rank of Eagle. When called upon, we provide manpower and/or financial assistance to those that request it - this is usually in the form of donations for/of supplies or by using our contacts to assist the Scout in their journey to Eagle.</p>

      <div class="my-3 py-3">
        <h2 class="mb-3">Positions</h2>
        <h4 class="mb-1">Hiring a Town Administrator</h4>
        <p class="pl-md-5">At the last town meeting, I voted for the approval of a Town Administrator.</p>
        <p class="pl-md-5">As part of hiring a Town Administrator, I would propose the formation of committees to work with our elected officials, under the office of the Town Administrator. While the Town Administrator would report to the Selectmen, these committees would be there specifically to support the Town Administrator and to provide assistance with the multitude of jobs required of the position (including, but not limited to, fiscal management, operational oversight, collective bargaining, capital planning, labor relations, public construction, and procurement).</p>
        <p class="pl-md-5">It takes the appropriate checks and balances, a strong leadership structure, and fiscal responsibility to bring any entity back to a positive position.</p>
        <h4 class="mb-1">Tasse's Fuel (propane installation)</h4>
        <p class="pl-md-5">
          <b>Disclaimer: As a current Planning Board member, I voted for the Tasse's Fuel plan</b>
        </p>
        <p class="pl-md-5">
          <b>Facts and Information:</b>
          Based off of the facts presented, I believe that having Tasse's Fuel in town would be a benefit to growing Brookfield's commercial footprint, while still maintaining a safe place to live. Not only is it permitted based off of the Brookfield Zoning By-Laws, but the installation and service has been approved by the Massachusetts State Fire Marshal's Office and no safety concerns have been expressed by either the Brookfield Fire Department or the Brookfield Police Department. Additionally, the current Board of Selectmen approved the storage license.
        </p>
        <p class="pl-md-5">
          <b>Financial Considerations:</b>
          According to the letter presented to the Town of Brookfield, Tasse's Fuel would bring in up to $25,000 a year in property and excise taxes. This money would be a of great use to the town, allowing us to improve our infrastructure, expand our community offerings (athletic fields updates, senior center enhancements, South Pond improvements, etc), and allow us to move towards a fiscally-positive position.
        </p>
        <h4 class="mb-1">Cable Access / Information Technology</h4>
        <p class="pl-md-5">Since I moved to Brookfield, I have watched various Town Meetings on YouTube, with varying degrees of quality and quantity of videos. Cable access, or any form of technology that provides accessibility to town functions, is pivotal for the community to become, and remain, engaged. With my background, I have the knowledge to assist the various committees with setting up video feeds and YouTube channels, which would allow Brookfield citizens to interact with the various committees, without having to be physically present (especially pertinent in this day and age).</p>
        <p class="pl-md-5">As a designer and developer, I would be able to apply my unique skills towards helping Brookfield grow our social footprint, and improve our continuity between our various platforms (website, Facebook, YouTube, etc), and reach out to those that have come to rely on technology in their daily lives.</p>
      </div>

  </section>
  <section class="d-md-flex flex-md-equal w-100" id="goals">
    <div class="d-md-flex pt-3 px-3 pt-md-5 px-md-5 overflow-hidden">
      <div class="my-3 py-3">
        <h2 class="mb-1">Goals</h2>
        <p class="pl-md-5">To put it simply, I am pro-business (especially small business) and pro-technology.</p>
        <p class="pl-md-5">As my Planning Board record shows, if there is nothing legally stopping a business from opening or moving to Brookfield, and that business would be a benefit to the town, I am for it. Brookfield has been passed over, for one reason or another, by many businesses (as one can easily see by those in East Brookfield, West Brookfield, North Brookfield, and Sturbridge) and that should not be the case. The town has a lot to offer, a strong community to support it (just look at the Clam Box!) and ample space for small business owners to grow and be successful.</p>
        <p class="pl-md-5">To anyone that has attended a board meeting of any kind this past year, it is clear to see that Brookfield is due for technological improvements. In the beginning, all of the boards used a variety of different conference calling systems (now seemingly synced on Zoom), with individual boards paying for subscriptions (rather than the town covering the cost for all, like a business would). Our town website is difficult to update, is often out-of-date (even with the boards and committees attempting to keep them up-to-date), and is not the easiest to find information on. Often times, one has to go to a non-town site in order to find meeting information and/or agendas.</p>
        <p class="pl-md-5">To improve the town's technology stance, I would switch over to a single Zoom account (rather than individual committees and board paying for their own), combine the various websites and data into one site (making a single source of information), and provide training and access to those in the community who wish to learn about the latest technology and options available to them. Everyone involved in a town position should know how to host a Zoom call (should the occasion arise), access their town email account (everyone should have one), and be able to connect with the community digitally. Without the Brookfield, MA Community Facebook group, I believe that a lot of information would have been missed by the residents, due to the lack of official digital communication.
